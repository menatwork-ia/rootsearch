Contao Multi-Root Search Engine
===============================

This extension provides a new search engine module which allows you to select several root pages instead of just one. This enables you to search accross multiple website roots (i.e. multiple domains or languages).

## Usage

There will be a new module called _Multi-Root search engine_. Within this module, the reference page selection is replaced by a website root selection:
